### Having trouble with Git or GitHub?

If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're better off if you [ask GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll end up getting a much faster (and smarter) response back that way.*

### Having trouble with a project I maintain?

If you have a bug report or creature request for a project I maintain, you're better off opening an issue in the project's repository, which will get it in front of other users/maintainers and make the conversation more easily discoverable for others who may have a similar request in the future.

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/benbalter/feedback/issues/new) on this repository.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.
