# Ask @benbalter anything

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from [@holman](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and [@mdo's](https://github.com/mdo/feedback) feedback repos and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

I often write and give talks about [open source + government](http://ben.balter.com) because I'm passionate about the disruptive potential for technology to reimagine the way our government works. If you have any questions about open government, or just questions in general, send 'em my way. Always more than glad to geek out.

*If you have any technical problems with Git or GitHub, you're still better off if you [ask GitHub Support directly](https://github.com/contact), since you'll end up getting a much faster (and smarter) response back that way.*

### Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/benbalter/feedback/issues/new) on this repository.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

### Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/benbalter/feedback/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1)
filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.

### Twitter

If you have something quick and easy, just ping me on Twitter. 140 characters
makes everyone more efficient. I'm [@benbalter](https://twitter.com/benbalter) on Twitter.
