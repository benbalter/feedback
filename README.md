# Ask @benbalter anything

This is a quick little ask-me-anything type of repository. It is forked from [@holman](https://github.com/holman/feedback) and [@mdo's](https://github.com/mdo/feedback) feedback repos and seems like a pretty fantastic idea in lieu of traditional blog comments, email, and the like.

I often write and give talks about [lots of different things](http://ben.balter.com) because I'm passionate about the disruptive potential for technology to reimagine the way we work. If you have any questions about something I wrote or presented, or just questions in general, send 'em my way. Always more than glad to geek out.

Looking to ask a question? See [the contributing guide](.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).
